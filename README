NAME
    ElasticSearchX::Sequence - Fast integer ID sequences with ElasticSearch

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use ElasticSearch();
        use ElasticSearchX::Sequence();

        my $es  = ElasticSearch->new();
        my $seq = ElasticSearchX::Sequence->new( es => $es );

        $seq->bootstrap();

        my $it  = $seq->sequence('mail_id');

        my $mail_id = $it->next;

DESCRIPTION
    ElasticSearchX::Sequence gives you a sequence of auto-incrementing
    integers (eg to use as IDs) that are guaranteed to be unique across your
    application.

    It is similar in spirit to DBIx::Sequence, but uses ElasticSearch as a
    backend.

MOTIVATION
    ElasticSearch already has built in unique IDs, but they look like this:
    "KpSb_Jd_R56dH5Qx6TtxVA".

    If you are migrating from an RDBM where you are using (eg) an
    auto-increment column to give you unique IDs, your application may
    depend on these IDs being integers. Or you may just prefer integer IDs.

    Either way, this module makes it easy to get these unique
    auto-incrementing IDs without needing an RDBM to provide them.

    And it is fast! Given the performance, if you are already using
    ElasticSearch, you may want to move your ticket servers from your
    database to ElasticSearch instead.

PERFORMANCE
    This module is blazing fast, especially when ElasticSearch uses the
    ElasticSearch::Transport::Curl backend.

    You can try out the benchmark yourself, in the "benchmark" folder in
    this distribution.

    The script compares:

    *   MySQL, using the ticket method described by Flickr
        <http://code.flickr.com/blog/2010/02/08/ticket-servers-distributed-u
        nique-primary-keys-on-the-cheap/>

    *   this module, using the httptiny backend

    *   this module, using the curl backend

    *   this module, using the curl backend but only requesting blocks of 10
        IDs at a time

    The results I get when running this on my laptop are:

                       Rate es_curl_10  db_ticket    es_tiny    es_curl
        es_curl_10  38760/s         --       -48%       -55%       -72%
        db_ticket   74627/s        93%         --       -13%       -47%
        es_tiny     85470/s       121%        15%         --       -39%
        es_curl    140845/s       263%        89%        65%         --

    Plus, with ElasticSearch, you get distributed and high-availability
    thrown in for free.

METHODS
  new()
        my $seq = ElasticSearchX::Sequence->new(
            es      => $es,         # ElasticSearch instance, required
            index   => 'index',     # defaults to 'sequence',
            type    => 'type',      # defaults to 'sequence',
        );

    "new()" returns a new instance of ElasticSearchX::Sequence. By default,
    your sequences will be stored in index "sequence", type "sequence", but
    you can change those values to whatever suits your application.

    By default, the index is optimised for serving sequences, and has
    different settings than those you would typically use in your main
    index, so rather than storing your sequences in the main index for your
    application(s), you may prefer to store all of your sequences in the
    single index "sequence".

    The type (default "sequence") could be used to separate sequences for
    different applications. For instance, you could store the sequences for
    your personal blog in type "personal" and for your work blog in type
    "work".

    See "bootstrap()" for how to initiate your index/type.

  sequence()
        my $it = $seq->sequence('mail_id');
        my $it = $seq->sequence( name => 'mail_id', size => 100 );

    The "sequence()" method returns a new sequence iterator identified by
    the "name".

    New IDs/values are generated in blocks of "size" (default 100), as this
    is much faster than requesting them individually.

    This does mean that, if you have several instances of the iterator
    "mail_id", then the next ID won't always be the highest number
    available. For instance:

        $i_1 = $seq->('mail_id');
        $i_2 = $seq->('mail_id');

        say $i_1->next;
        say $i_2->next;
        say $i_1->next;
        # 1
        # 101
        # 2

    See also ElasticSearchX::Sequence::Iterator.

  bootstrap()
        $seq->bootstrap( %settings );

    This method will create the index, if it doesn't already exist, and will
    setup the type. This can be called even if the index and type have
    already been setup. It won't fail unless the type already exists and has
    a different mapping / definition.

    By default, the index is setup with the following %settings:

        (
            number_of_shards     => 1,
            auto_expand_replicas => '0-all',
        )

    In other words, it will have only a single primary shard (instead of the
    ElasticSearch default of 5), and a replica of that shard on every
    ElasticSearch node in your cluster.

    If you pass in any %settings then the defaults will not be used at all.

    ettings.html> for more.

  delete_index()
        $seq->delete_index()

    Deletes the index associated with the sequence. You will lose your data!

  delete_type()
        $seq->delete_type()

    Deletes the type associated with the sequence. You will lose your data!

  index()
        $index = $seq->index

    Read-only getter for the index value

  type()
        $type = $seq->type

    Read-only getter for the type value

  es()
        $es = $seq->es

    Read-only getter for the ElasticSearch instance.
